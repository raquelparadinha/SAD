The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature selection, class imbalance treatment, and logistic regression-based prediction. Additionally, there is a simple user interface for testing new data.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
Visualize class distribution.
Normalize data.
Analyze the correlation matrix.


### Feature Selection
Select most relevant features for model training.


### Class Imbalance Treatment
Apply SMOTE to address class imbalance.


### Logistic Regression
Train a logistic regression model.
Evaluate model performance (accuracy, precision, and recall).


### Testing New Data
Use the GUI to input and test new data.


### Interface
A simple tkinter-based GUI for data input and testing.
